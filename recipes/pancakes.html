    <p>You don't need a box to make great fluffy pancakes. Making them from scratch is just as easy and so much better.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li> 3/4 cup buttermilk * </li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>Maple syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>* If you don't have buttermilk, add two tablespoons of white vinegar to 3/4 cup regular milk and let sit for 5 minutes</em></p>
    <p></p>
    <h3><strong>Directions:</strong></h3>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a mixing bowl and whisk to combine</li>
        <li>Place milk, butter, and egg into a separate mixing bowl and whisk to combine</li>
        <li>Pour dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and whisk until all lumps are gone. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Coat with cooking spray</li>
        <li>Pour desired amount of batter onto skillet. This recipe works best making 2-3 smaller pancakes rather than 1 large pancake.</li>
        <li>Cook pancakes until small bubbles start to form on the surface. Flip pancake and continue to cook until brown on the other side.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with maple syrup.</li>
