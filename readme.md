This is part of the foundations course of The Odin Project.
This will be a recipes website created using html. On top of that, I will also be learning proper git commit tags and cycles.

Update: I have completed my first html website with The Odin Project. One thing I failed to do was to regularly commit my changes as I worked. Instead I completed the website locally and uploaded everything all at once. I tried to make my commit message clear and consise as I could, but in hindsight I should have done it more often so I would have more detailed commit messages.

Next time I will commit more often. This will also help me get used to git commands in the terminal.
